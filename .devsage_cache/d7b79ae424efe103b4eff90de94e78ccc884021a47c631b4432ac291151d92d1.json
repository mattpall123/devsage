{"summary": "This new code file, movieclient.js, introduces functionality related to user interaction with movie ratings. It allows users to select a star rating for a movie and submit it to the server using a POST request. The code handles events for clicking on stars to set a rating and for double-clicking to reset the stars. It also includes logic for sending the rating data to the server, updating the UI with the new rating, storing the data in localStorage for future use, and handling errors. Additionally, it initializes rating data when the page loads and includes functionality for a hamburger menu. This file primarily contributes to the user experience aspect of the system by enabling users to interact with and view movie ratings."}
